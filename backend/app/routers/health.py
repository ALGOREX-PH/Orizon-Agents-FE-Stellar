"""Liveness probe, re-served under the frontend proxy's `/api` prefix.

The product frontend reaches this API only through a same-origin rewrite of
`/api/*`, so the root `/health` route — which sits OUTSIDE that prefix — is
unreachable from the browser and from any uptime monitor pointed at the
public domain. A total outage (every `/api/*` call 404ing) can therefore go
unnoticed. This router answers the identical payload at `GET /api/health`.

`health_payload()` is the single source of that payload: both the root route
in main.py and this one call it, so the two bodies can never drift.
